### Structuring Data

### What numbers can we represent on a Computer?

- We can represent positive and negative integers (with certain bounds)
- We can (almost) represent decimal numbers like 0.5 and 0.6 and so forth
- Can we accurately represent 1/3?
- Can we accurately represent $\sqrt(2)$ 
- Can we accurately represent $\pi$

### Rational

- A ratioanl number is any number that cna be expressed as the quotient (ratio) p/q of two integers.

### Is sqrt(2) Rational?

- Suppose $\sqrt(2)$ 
  - then $\sqrt(2) = m/n$
  - so, $(m/n)^2 = 2$
  - $m^2 = 2n^2$
- So $m$ must be even
  - Put $m = 2p$
  - Then:
  - $4p^2 = 2n^2$
  - So, $n$ must be even
  - Contradiction.
