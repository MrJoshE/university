### Week 2



##### Advantages and Disadvantages of Digital

###### Digital 'data' includes:

- Text (email, news, scientific papers, technical documents, literature, etc)
- Images (personal photos, news, paintings, medical images, etc)
- Video (home video, TV, films etc)
- Audio (speech, radio, music, etc)
- Web 1.0, Web 2.0, ... Web 4.0
- Graphics and Virtual Reality

###### Advantages:

- Information stored digitally can be computed and used in other computational systems.
- Multiple copies can be made of digital information / files.
- It is easy to create and access more information digitally.
- Remote access is possible and simultaneous use is avaliable.
- **More and more data; more and more forms of data; findability now becomes more challenging.**

###### Disadvantages

- As **volume** increases, it becomes harder to find what you want amongst all of the stuff you do not need **(Information overload)**
- Variety of information makes for another problem (conflicting information for example)
- Information can only be of value if it can be retrieved and used efficiently - velocity matters.

##### Media and Multimedia, old and new

###### Applications for indexing, retrieving and browsing multimedia data

- Google, iTunes, Autonomy, Youtube are availible for retrieving / indexing / browsing multimedia data.
- All allow users to make queries in some form which are then somehow matched with stored data.

##### Using Digital Content

"rich variety of sensory inputs thatmake up images, text, moving picture and sound must be reduced to patterns of binary digits inside a computer"

A line of text would look like this = 001010001010101101111010100101010101

- Why might this be a problem? - Humans will find it hard to query it.



##### Web Crawling

###### Architecture of a search system:

- Texts are retrieved by the **Crawler Module** into the **Page Repository**
- Then analysed by the **Indexing Module** [which does similar things to those in Labs 1, 2, 3] 
- Results from the analysis form the basis of the searchable **Indexes**
