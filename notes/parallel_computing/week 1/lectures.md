## History and why its become so relavent now vs before

Previously processing speed has increased faster than developers were able to convert serial programs into concurrent programs but due to the increase in technological improvements over time causing the increase in the speed of which we develop new technologies and how much easier its becoming to do so, combined with the physical constraints of increasing computational power we are at the stage where we can add more **cores** to processors and write more **concurrent** programs to use them cores faster than the computational power is increasing.
