# Business Needs

Protection of the confidentiality, integrity and availability of information assets in storage, processing or transmission via application of technology, policy and SETA.

## Critical Characteristics - The CIA Triad

### Confidentialilty

Information has confidentiality when it is protected from disclosure or exposure to unauthorised individuals or systems
  
### Integrity

Information has integrity when it is whole, complete or uncorrupted

### Availability

Enables authorised users - people or computer systems - to access information without interference or obstruction and receive it in the required format.

## Other critical characteristics

- Accuracy - describes how data is free from errors and has the value that the user expects
- Authenticity - describes how data is genuine or original rather than reproduced or fabricated
- Utility - describes how data has value or usefulness for an end purpose
- Possession - describes how the data's ownership or control is legitimate or authorised.

## Main business needs for I.S

### Protect the organisations ability to function
- More about policies and processes than technology
- Concerned with impact and costs of business interruptions
### Enable safe operation of applications implemented on IT systems
- E.g. your OS, mail / webservers, desktop software etc
### Protect the organisation’s data
- The most critical aspect as without data the ability to deliver is most likely lost
- Need to protect data at rest , in use and in transit 
### Safeguard the technology assets in use at the organisation
- Physical security – locks, secure areas, etc
- Technologies – firewalls, PKI, caching

## Consider

- How does implementing information security differ from implementing a new product?
- What’s different in terms of project outcomes? 
- Are these differences a challenge / problem?

## Ansers

Most ‘normal’ projects
- Implement a new product / program, introduce new technologies etc
- Have some measurable success factors – sales, satisfaction, share
Security projects
- Have a primary mission to ensure systems and contents are kept the same
- Are difficult to measure in terms of success
It can be a struggle to get business approval and continuing support

## Consider

- What factors might contribute to the valuation of an asset? 
- How might you calculate, estimate or derive asset values?

## Answers

- Purchase cost, development cost, value to owners, users, competitors
- Productivity enhancement or degradation, loss liability, IP or equity value
Questions that help develop criteria for asset valuation: Which asset ...
- Is most critical to business success?
- Generates the most revenue / profitability?
- Would be the most expensive to replace or protect?
- Would be the most embarrassing or cause greatest liability if revealed?
