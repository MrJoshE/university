# What is security

## Assets

- Real Assets - money, buildings, hardware, people
- Information Assets - client / staff details, payroll, design
- Intangible assets - brand, reputation, plans

## Information Systems

### Components of an IS are made up

- Software
- Hardware
- Data
- People
- Network / Telecommunications
- Procedures

### Software

Made up of:
  - Applications
  - Operating Systems
  - Assorted command utilities

- It's aruably the most difficult IS component to secure.
- The exploitation of software errors in programming accounts for a substantial proportion of attacks on information.
- Most software is developed under time and money pressures
- As such, as information security is added as an afterthought, rather than embedded as an integral part from the start

### Hardware

The physical technology:
  - Houses and executes the software
  - Stores and carries the data
  - Provides the interface for data entry / manipulation / removal

- Traditional physical security like locks and keys restrict access to, and interaction with the hardware components.
- Securing the physical location of the hardware is important and often just having physical access means the information can be accessed.
- The hardware may be cheap, but the stored information...

### Data

- Data is usually the most valuable asset possessed by an organisation
- Usually the main target of intentional attacks
- Data stored in databases, used properly, should increase the security of the data
- Sometimes the databases are used in ways that make data less secure

### People

- Often overlooked in security consideration, but one of the greatest threats/
- Often the weakest link as they:
- Make mistakes 
- Fall for social engineering attacks
- Are bribe-able, can be blackmailed.

- Doing the 'right thing' requires the proper use of ...
  - Policies
  - Education, training and awareness
  - Technologies

### Procedures

- Documented instructions to accomplish a certain task is a potential security risk
- Knowledge of a procedure may aid unauthorised use to obtain / change / introduce data into the system
- Staff often not educated in protecting procedures

### Networks

- Component that increased need for information security
- As information systems are connected and interconnected, new security challenges rapidly emerge
- Locks / Keys may prevent physical access, but remove access is now possible.
- Netowkr security now essential as is the implementation of alarm and intrusion detection system.

## Summary

- Three types of assets (real, intangible, information)
- Six Information System Components (networks, software, hardware, physical, people, data)
